# This defaults to the localhost listening addresses and port 3493.
# In case of IP v4 or v6 disabled kernel, only the available one will be used.

# You may specify each interface you want upsd to listen on for connections,
# optionally with a port number.
#
# You may need this if you have multiple interfaces on your machine and
# you don't want upsd to listen to all interfaces (for instance on a
# firewall, you may not want to listen to the external interface).
#
# This will only be read at startup of upsd.  If you make changes here,
# you'll need to restart upsd, reload will have no effect.

# ferrarimarco's Home Lab

All the necessary to provision, configure and manage my home lab.

Before using the home lab, you initialize the environments by executing
a manual process. After the initalization process completes,
automated processes take care of applying provisioning and
configuration changes to the environments.

## Get started

For more information about how to set up the lab, see:

- [Initialize the home lab on physical hardware](./docs/installation/README.md).

## Architecture

For more information about the architecture of the lab, see

Hi, I'm Marco, your friendly neighborhood engineer!

I work as a Cloud Solutions Architect at Google. My team takes care of solving
the hardest technical issues, and first-of-a-kind problems. Then, we build
repeatable solutions for customers to use.

My focus areas are:

- AI infrastructure and accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, etc.)
- AI inference reference architectures
- Migrations (from other cloud providers and on premises environments) to Google
  Cloud
- [Platform Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_engineering),
  [Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering),
  and [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)
- Arm (Axion) on Google Cloud
- [Federated Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning)
- 3D and AI-powered digital twins
